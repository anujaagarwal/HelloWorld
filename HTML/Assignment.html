    <p text align="left"> Please don't skip this 1-minute read. 
        I'm sorry to interrupt, but our fundraiser won’t last long. 
        This Saturday, 2 September, I humbly request you to reflect 
        on the number of times you visited Wikipedia in the past year, 
        the value you got from it, and whether you're able to contribute ₹ 25. If you can, 
        kindly join the 2% of readers who donate. If everyone reading this right now gave ₹ 25, we'd reach our goal in a couple of hours.

        When I set up the Wikimedia Foundation as a nonprofit to 
        host Wikipedia and 12 other free knowledge projects, it 
        meant that we could preserve our core values: neutral, 
        high quality information, not outrage and sensationalism. 
        Being a nonprofit means there is no danger that someone will buy Wikipedia and turn it into their personal space.
